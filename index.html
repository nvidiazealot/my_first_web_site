<h2>What is Bigbang Theory</h2>
<h3><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong></h3>
Welcome to  my world<br>

<p style="margin-top:40px;"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">The Big Bang Theory</a> is the leading explanation for how the universe began. Simply put, it says the universe as we know it started with an infinitely hot and dense single point that inflated and stretched — first at unimaginable speeds, and then at a more measurable rate — over the next 13.7 billion years to the still-expanding cosmos that we know today.</p>

<p>Existing technology doesn't yet allow astronomers to literally peer back at the universe's birth, much of what we understand about the Big Bang comes from mathematical formulas and models. Astronomers can, however, see the "echo" of the expansion through a phenomenon known as the cosmic microwave background.</p>
